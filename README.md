# SC2006

## 50% Lab Report
- Made up of i think 5% from each lab session submitted (4 labs) + final presentation and submission
- Then (peer review percentage * total score calculated above)

### Final Presentation
- Focus on software architectural principles/patterns (SOLID, DAO, etc.)
- The way to score better is that you have to present like you're presenting to a client (eg. see our slides, must tie in reasons why this product was made)
- Pre-record so you have a backup

## 50% Finals
- Open book so just print out all lecture slides (16 pages in one page) + all PYPs
- MUST DO PYP, because every year finals is basically the same
- Learn those diagrams that the slides never really cover (eg. swimlane ...)
